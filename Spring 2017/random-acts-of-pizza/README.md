In machine learning, it is often said there are no free lunches. How wrong we were.

This competition contains a dataset with 5671 textual requests for pizza from the Reddit community [Random Acts of Pizza](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/) together with their outcome (successful/unsuccessful) and meta-data. Participants must create an algorithm capable of predicting which requests will garner a cheesy (but sincere!) act of kindness.

"I'll write a poem, sing a song, do a dance, play an instrument, whatever! I just want a pizza," says one hopeful poster. What about making an algorithm?

Kaggle is hosting this competition for the machine learning community to use for fun and practice. This [data](http://cs.stanford.edu/~althoff/raop-dataset/) was collected and graciously shared by Althoff et al. (Buy them a pizza -- data collection is a thankless and tedious job!) We encourage participants to explore their [accompanying paper](http://cs.stanford.edu/~althoff/raop-dataset/altruistic_requests_icwsm.pdf) and ask that you cite the following reference in any publications that result from your work:
