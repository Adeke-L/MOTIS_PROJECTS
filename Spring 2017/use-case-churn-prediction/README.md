# [Use case 6 : Churn Prediction](http://dataiku.teachable.com/p/use-case-churn-prediction)
## Advanced Machine Learning and Custom Code in Dataiku DSS

In this tutorial, you will learn how to embed your own machine learning algorithms in Dataiku DSS, leveraging its ability to integrate easily external libraries and programs. To build a predictive model to find likely churners in a telecom dataset, we will implement machine learning using the following libraries:

* Python and the famous scikit-learn library (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* R and the caret package (http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html)
* H20 (distributed ML) (http://www.h2o.ai/)
* Vowpal Wabbit (online learning)http://www.h2o.ai/)

In the end, you should be able to use complex arbitrary code in Python, R, or Shell to implement custom machine learning models using cutting-edge algorithms
